# Banking Risk Analysis  

## 📌 Project Overview  
This project analyzes publicly available **banking data** from Kaggle to uncover insights into customer financial behavior and potential risk factors. The focus is on **exploratory data analysis (EDA)** using statistical and visualization techniques.  

## 📊 Objectives  
- Explore customer data to identify key financial patterns  
- Perform **univariate, bivariate, and numerical analysis**  
- Visualize correlations using **heatmaps**  
- Derive actionable insights regarding customer risk behavior  

## 📂 Dataset  
- Source: [Kaggle Banking Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/)  
- Features include:  
  - Estimated Income  
  - Superannuation Savings  
  - Credit Card Balance

  - Bank Deposits  
  - Checking Accounts  
  - Saving Accounts  
  - Foreign Currency Account  
  - Business Lending  

## 🛠️ Libraries Used  
- **pandas** – data manipulation  
- **numpy** – numerical operations  
- **seaborn** – statistical data visualization  
- **matplotlib** – general plotting  

## 🔍 Analysis Performed  
1. **Bivariate Analysis** – explored relationships between two variables  
2. **Numerical Analysis** – examined distribution of continuous features  
3. **Correlation & Heatmaps** – identified dependencies among numerical features  

## 💡 Key Insight  
- The **strongest positive correlation** was observed among:  
  - **Bank Deposits** with **Checking Accounts**  
  - **Bank Deposits** with **Saving Accounts**  
  - **Bank Deposits** with **Foreign Currency Accounts**
